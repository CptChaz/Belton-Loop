###Derivative, hacky, and unpolished - Perfectly good plugins for Unmanic that have been tweaked

With absolutely no formal coding or programming experience, the purpose of this repo is to change 
and modify existing plugins for the Unmanic application. This repo values function over form. In 
most cases, plugins are only modified on the backend so extreme caution should be used in 
implementation. In fact, i would recommend only using/installing these plugins in a suitable test 
environment of Unmanic and media libraries before deploying on anything "mission critical". i 
welcome any thoughts as long as they come with really low expectations. Most importantly, it 
should be noted that everything here is derivative and that all credit should go to Josh.5, 
the creator and proprietor of Unmanic and it's official repo.
